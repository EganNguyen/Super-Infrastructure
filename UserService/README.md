This project integrates foundational infrastructure and best coding practices I have previously implemented. 
Applying these technology stacks within this infrastructure in real-world projects enhances development efficiency.

Infrastucture:
- Microservices Architecture
- API Gateways
- Database Replication
- RabbitMQ, Kafka for asynchronous messaging
- gRPC, RESTful API for synchronous communication
- Grafana for logging and monitoring
- MinIO (S3 Storage)
